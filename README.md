# PooKarma

Welcome to PooKarma! This project was developed during the "Hack the Future" hackathon by FreeTail Hackers in March 2023, organized by UT Austin. The theme of the hackathon was "Earth Sustainability," and PooKarma aims to promote a cleaner environment by encouraging people to pick up dog poop.



## Overview

PooKarma is a mobile application that rewards users for cleaning up after their dogs. Users can upload pictures of themselves picking up dog poop to earn PooKarma points. These points can be redeemed on a leaderboard, creating a sense of community and friendly competition. The app also features a map showing where dog poop is being collected, helping to raise awareness of the environmental impact of dog waste.


## Features
